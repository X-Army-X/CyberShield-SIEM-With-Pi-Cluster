\# Hardware Design – Raspberry Pi Cluster Case



\## Overview

This folder contains the hardware design artifacts for the Cyber-Shield Pi 5 cluster.



The 3D-printed enclosure was designed to:

\- Securely house three Raspberry Pi nodes

\- Allow airflow for passive/active cooling

\- Support cable management (Ethernet, power)

\- Provide physical separation between nodes



\## Contents

\- `3d-model/` – Editable 3mf files for the cluster enclosure

\- `renders/` – Rendered images used for documentation and presentation



\## Notes

The enclosure design supports modular expansion and reflects the physical deployment used in this project.
